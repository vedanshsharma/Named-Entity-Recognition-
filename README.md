Named entity recognition (NER)is probably the first step towards information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. NER is used in many fields in Natural Language Processing (NLP).<br>
It can help answering many real-world questions, such as:
<ul>
<li>Which companies were mentioned in the news article?</li>
<li>Were specified products mentioned in complaints or reviews?</li>
<li>Does the tweet contain the name of a person? Does the tweet contain this personâ€™s location?</li>
  </ul>
